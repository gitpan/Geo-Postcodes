 * Released version 0.03.

 * Simplified the 'selection' code by removing the need
   for passing a list of legal methods. This is now obtained
   by the selection code itself.

2006-07-19 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'get_types' procedure that returns all the
   types (of the postal locations). Added the 'type2verbose'
   procedure to convert the code to an english text.

2006-07-20 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Made a major rewrite of the documentation.

2006-07-19 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Merged the national (norwegian and danish) postal
   type codes, and moved them here. 'type' and 'type_of'
   will now give the code (instead of the description).
   Use the new prodeure 'type_verbose_of' and method
   'type_verbose' for the description. The base class
   has english texts, but this can be overruled by the
   derived classes.

2006-07-18 18:00 Arne Sommer
