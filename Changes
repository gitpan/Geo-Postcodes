Revision history for Perl extension Geo::Postcodes
--------------------------------------------------
2006-09-03 23:30 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.20.

2006-09-03 22:30 Arne Sommer
 * Fixed the errors and warnings in the documentation, as reported by
   'podchecker'.

2006-09-03 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedure '_verify_selectionlist', which will false (0) followed
   by a list of diagnostic messages if the argument list is invalid for use by
   the 'selection'-procedure. It will return true (1) followed by a modified
   argument list if the arguments are valid. The modification replaces things
   as 'and', 'not' with 'and not'. The procedure is callable from the child
   classes (with some black magic).

2006-09-03 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the modes 'xor not', 'nor' and 'nor not' in the selection procedure.

2006-09-01 17:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedures 'get_selectionmodes' and 'get_initial_selectionmodes'
   to get a (sorted) list of the legal selection modes.

2006-09-01 11:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedures 'is_legal_selectionmode' and
   'is_legal_initial_selectionmode' so that application programs easily can
   check for legal selection modes.

2006-09-01 01:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the mode 'none' in the selection procedure. It will return absolutely
   nothing, and is absolutely useless.

2006-08-31 23:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for the mode 'all' as the first parameter in the selection
   procedure, as the old version of the procedure had it.

2006-08-31 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for the mode 'not' as the first parameter in the selection
   procedure, as it is clearer than 'and or' or 'and not'.

2006-08-31 16:00 Arne Sommer
 * Reimplemented the selection procedure, with the following modes only:
   "and", "or", "and not" (new), "or not" (instead of 'not'), and "xor"
   (new).

2006-08-17 15:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.10.

2006-08-16 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Fixed an error that caused a list with one element (a zero) to be returned
   instead of 'undef' by selection when no matches were found.

2006-08-05 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for 'selection("all", ...)'. It does exactly the same as
   'get_postcodes' (but sorts the postcodes). It can be used to get them as
   objects, in oo-mode. This will consume a lot of memory - and time.

2006-08-05 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for 'selection("not", ...)'. It will include the postcode if
   it doesn't match any of the specified method/value pairs.

2006-07-30 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support in 'selection' for multiple sets of method/value. This
   requires a choice of how to treat the combination, and this is controlled
   by the new 'and' and 'or' parameter.

2006-07-30 09:00 Arne Sommer
 * Renamed the 'methods' procedure/method to 'get_methods'.

2006-07-23 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.03.

2006-07-23 10:00 Arne Sommer
 * Simplified the 'selection' code by removing the need for passing a list of
   legal methods. This is now obtained by the selection code itself.

2006-07-19 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'get_types' procedure that returns all the types (of the postal
   locations). Added the 'type2verbose' procedure to convert the code to an
   english text.

2006-07-20 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Made a major rewrite of the documentation.

2006-07-19 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Merged the national (norwegian and danish) postal type codes, and moved
   them here. 'type' and 'type_of' will now give the code (instead of the
   description). Use the new prodeure 'type_verbose_of' and method
   'type_verbose' for the description. The base class has english texts, but
   this can be overruled by the derived classes.

2006-07-18 23:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.02.

2006-07-18 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'methods' and 'is_method' method/procedure.

2006-07-15 12:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'selection' method/procedure, and made it callable from the child
   classes (with some black magic).

2006-07-10 16:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.01.

2006-07-07 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Original version; created by "h2xs -Xan Geo::Postcodes".
