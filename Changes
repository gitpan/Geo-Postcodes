Revision history for Perl extension Geo::Postcodes
--------------------------------------------------
2006-08-17 15:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.10.

2006-08-16 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Fixed an error that caused a list with one element
   (a zero) to be returned instead of 'undef' by
   selection when no matches was found.

2006-08-05 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for 'selection("all", ...)'. It does
   exactly the same as 'get_postcodes' (but sorts the
   postcodes). It can be used to get them as objects,
   in oo-mode. This will consume a lot of memory - and
   time.

2006-08-05 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for 'selection("not", ...)'. It will
   include the postcode if it doesn't match any of the
   specified method/value pairs.

2006-07-30 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support in 'selection' for multiple sets
   of method/value. This requires a choice of how
   to treat the combination, and this is controlled
   by the new 'and' and 'or' paramter.

2006-07-30 09:00 Arne Sommer
 * Renamed the 'methods' procedure/method to 'get_methods'.

2006-07-23 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.03.

2006-07-23 10:00 Arne Sommer
 * Simplified the 'selection' code by removing the need
   for passing a list of legal methods. This is now obtained
   by the selection code itself.

2006-07-19 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'get_types' procedure that returns all the
   types (of the postal locations). Added the 'type2verbose'
   procedure to convert the code to an english text.

2006-07-20 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Made a major rewrite of the documentation.

2006-07-19 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Merged the national (norwegian and danish) postal
   type codes, and moved them here. 'type' and 'type_of'
   will now give the code (instead of the description).
   Use the new prodeure 'type_verbose_of' and method
   'type_verbose' for the description. The base class
   has english texts, but this can be overruled by the
   derived classes.

2006-07-18 23:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.02.

2006-07-18 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'methods' and 'is_method' method/procedure.

2006-07-15 12:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'selection' method/procedure, and made it
   callable from the child classes (with some black magic).

2006-07-10 16:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.01.

2006-07-07 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Original version; created by "h2xs -Xan Geo::Postcodes".
